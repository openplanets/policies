Policies
=============

This repository has a simple ontology to be used throught PW. It defines control-policies, criteria, properties (RIP, IP, TIP, etc.) and
some other related clases. There are also some examples of properties, criteria, objectives and scenarios that should give insight
of what is possible. Please take a look in the ´harmonised´ folder for the current version of the ontology and the individuals.

You can find some experiments and queries within the ´experiments´ folder.
