Digital Preservation - Vocabulary
=================================

It consists of a set of simple onotologies, which can be used to describe quality measures, control properties, preservation cases, and some other related classes.

This common vocabulary allows interoperability between 
* Characterisation 
* Quality Assurance
* Policies
* Planning

The vocabulary is organised as follows:

* Quality Model (quality.rdf)
  Describes criteria, properties (RIP, IP, TIP, etc.)
  
* Control Policies (control-policy.rdf)

* Preservation Case (preservation-case.rdf)
  Formerly known as Scenario
  
* An example of a preservation case: obl_policies.rdf
